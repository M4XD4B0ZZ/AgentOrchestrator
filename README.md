# agent-orchestrator (`agent-loop`)

Foundation for a repository-agnostic orchestrator that will coordinate two
already-installed CLI agents:

- **Claude Code** — the only agent allowed to write.
- **Codex CLI** — a strictly read-only reviewer.

Both are intended to run on their existing **subscription logins**, never on
API keys.

> **There is no orchestration loop in this build.** Task creation, worktree
> management, implement/verify/review rounds and resume handling are not
> implemented. No command in this build starts an agent.

What *is* implemented:

1. A standalone TypeScript CLI project.
2. The binding **single-task state contract** (Zod → generated JSON Schema,
   plus an explicit state-transition table).
3. The read-only diagnosis command `agent-loop doctor`.

## Requirements

- Node.js **22 or newer** (24 LTS recommended)
- npm
- Git

## Install

```powershell
npm install
```

## Build and verify

```powershell
npm run schema:generate   # regenerate schemas/task-state.schema.json from Zod
npm run typecheck         # tsc --noEmit, strict
npm test                  # vitest
npm run build             # emit dist/ (Node-executable CLI)
```

`schemas/task-state.schema.json` is **generated**. Do not edit it by hand — a
test fails if it no longer matches the Zod schema in `src/core/task-state.ts`.

## Link the CLI globally

```powershell
npm link
agent-loop --help
```

`bin.agent-loop` points at `dist/cli/index.js`, so `npm run build` must have run
first.

## `agent-loop doctor`

```powershell
agent-loop doctor
```

A read-only local diagnosis. It:

- reports which of four API-key environment variables are `SET` / `NOT_SET`
  (never their values, lengths, prefixes or hashes) and builds a **sanitised
  child environment** with those four removed. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is
  deliberately preserved — it is a subscription OAuth path, not an API key;
- probes the locally installed CLIs with `--version` / `--help` from a static
  allow-list of commands, and records argv, exit code, start/end time,
  duration, a fixed failure code and whether the process started at all. The
  probes' `stdout`/`stderr` are **discarded**: only an extracted version
  number and allow-listed flag/subcommand names survive (see
  [Artefacts](#artefacts)). Every probe runs with a wall-clock timeout **and**
  a hard byte budget per stream, both enforced while the output streams; a
  child that exceeds either is terminated together with its whole process tree
  (on Windows via `taskkill /T /F` with a validated numeric PID, so a `.cmd`
  shim cannot leave the real program running);
- checks that Claude Code reports a **Claude subscription** login and that
  Codex reports a **ChatGPT** login, using a fail-closed allow-list. The Codex
  check accepts *only* a command whose total normalised output — stdout and
  stderr together — is exactly the single line `Logged in using ChatGPT`. (The
  installed Codex CLI 0.146.0 writes that line to stderr and leaves stdout
  empty, which is why both streams are evaluated as one.) Extra words, an extra
  line, a mixed "ChatGPT and API key" message, a plan suffix, a warning, a
  banner or a localised wording all fail closed;
- probes Node/npm/Git/Claude/Codex versions and write access to the
  orchestrator home and worktrees root, using reversible probe files that are
  deleted immediately.

It never runs an agent task, never modifies a repository or any configuration,
never changes global environment variables, never performs a login, and never
reads a credential store.

### Artefacts

The orchestrator is repository-agnostic, so **nothing is ever written relative
to the current working directory**. Persistent diagnostics go to the per-user
application-data root, and **every run gets its own immutable directory**:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.agent-orchestrator\diagnostics\doctor\runs\<run-id>\   (Windows)
$HOME/.agent-orchestrator/diagnostics/doctor/runs/<run-id>/           (POSIX)
```

`<run-id>` is a UTC timestamp plus a cryptographically random UUID, validated
as a single path segment, e.g. `20260801T121500123Z-<uuid>`.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `cli-capabilities.txt` | Structured capability summary — facts only, no process output |
| `doctor-report.json` | Machine-readable report, carrying its own run id and run path |

The console summary prints the exact run directory it used. The write path is
containment-checked, exclusive and atomic:

- the run directory is created with `mkdir` **without** `recursive`, so an
  already existing directory is an error and never a reuse;
- the file name must resolve directly inside that run directory; separators,
  `..` and absolute names are refused;
- a symbolic link or Windows junction anywhere in the directory path aborts the
  write;
- **nothing is ever overwritten.** Anything already occupying a target name —
  file, directory or link — aborts the write. There is no ownership check,
  because there is nothing to take ownership of: the earlier scheme proved
  ownership by looking for a marker string *inside* the existing file, and that
  marker is printed into every artefact, so anyone could plant it;
- content is written to a temporary file in the same run directory and
  finalised with an atomic, exclusive `link`, so a concurrent run fails with
  `EEXIST` instead of clobbering anything. The temporary file is removed on
  every path, including every failure path;
- on failure only what *this* run created is cleaned up: its temporary files
  and, if it is still empty, its own run directory.

Retention of old completed runs is not implemented yet — they are left alone.

### What the artefacts may contain

Both artefacts are built from a closed vocabulary. Raw CLI `stdout`/`stderr`,
exception messages and unknown status output are **not representable** in
them:

- **capability probes** contribute only: the probe id, the program as a fixed
  known label, the statically configured argv, start status, exit code,
  timestamps, duration, a fixed timeout/spawn/output-limit code, an allow-listed
  `errno` identifier, a strictly extracted version number, allow-listed
  subcommand and flag names, boolean capability answers, and a flag recording
  that the raw output was discarded. **The former raw `--help`/`--version` dump
  in `cli-capabilities.txt` was removed for security reasons:** pattern-based
  redaction cannot recognise unknown sensitive content, so process output is
  discarded rather than sanitised. Token recognition is conservative — a token
  must match a strict syntactic pattern *and* appear in a closed vocabulary, so
  a probe cannot introduce a new string into an artefact; output that yields no
  recognised token leaves the capability `UNKNOWN`, which fails closed;
- **auth checks** carry a fixed reason code, its static description, the
  constant argv, the numeric exit code, and — only on PASS — typed allow-list
  evidence. For Claude that is exactly `loggedIn`, `authMethod`, `apiProvider`
  and `subscriptionType`; account email, organisation id and organisation name
  are never copied, on success or failure;
- **CLI versions** are reported as an extracted dotted number, never as a whole
  output line;
- **filesystem failures** are reported as a fixed code plus an `errno`
  identifier drawn from a closed allow-list (`ENOENT`, `EACCES`, `EPERM`, …);
  anything else becomes `UNKNOWN`;
- **every error** a user ever sees goes through one central safe formatter. It
  emits only our own domain errors' `safeMessage` (recognised by `instanceof`,
  never by a name string) or the fixed code `UNEXPECTED_ERROR`. A foreign
  `error.name`, `error.code` or `error.message` is never printed, however
  well-formed it looks.

`src/auth/redaction.ts` remains as a defence-in-depth helper for future
free-form text. It is deliberately *not* the boundary and is not applied to any
persisted artefact — the boundary is that unknown text is never copied at all.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | `overallStatus: PASS` — every mandatory check passed |
| `1` | `overallStatus: FAIL` — a check failed, or a mandatory check only warned |

A `WARN` on a non-mandatory check does not fail the run. The only warnings
modelled that way are ones with a documented reason why they are neither a
security nor an execution risk — for example an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present in
the parent environment, which is removed from every child environment by a
unit-tested guard and therefore cannot reach an agent.

The auth checks **fail closed**: they pass only on positively recognised
subscription output. Unknown, empty or unparseable status output is a failure,
not a pass. A `FAIL` from `agent-loop doctor` is a real finding about the local
machine, not a defect in the tool.

### Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENT_LOOP_WORKTREES_ROOT` | Root for future per-task worktrees (probed only, never written to) | `D:\AgentWorktrees` |

The persistent write root is **not configurable**:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.agent-orchestrator\      (Windows)
$HOME/.agent-orchestrator/              (POSIX)
```

It is derived from the OS user identity, and no CLI flag, environment variable
or repository file can move it. `AGENT_LOOP_HOME` used to relocate it and has
been **removed**: a variable that redirects where a diagnostics run writes its
files is a privilege the diagnosis does not need. If it is still set, the value
is ignored and never read or printed; the doctor reports a non-blocking warning
carrying only the fixed code `UNSUPPORTED_HOME_OVERRIDE_IGNORED`.

Tests redirect the root through internal dependency injection
(`src/config/internal/path-provider.ts`), which is not exported from the
package and not reachable from the CLI.

## The task-state contract

Source of truth: `src/core/task-state.ts` (Zod 4).
Generated artefact: `schemas/task-state.schema.json` (via `z.toJSONSchema()`).

### States

Regular: `CREATED`, `REPOSITORY_RESOLVED`, `CONFIG_VALIDATED`, `AUTH_PREFLIGHT`,
`GIT_PREFLIGHT`, `WORKTREE_READY`, `CONTEXT_LOADING`, `IMPLEMENTING`,
`VERIFYING`, `REVIEWING`, `REMEDIATING`, `READY_FOR_PR`.

Blocking / terminal: `BLOCKED_AUTH`, `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT`, `BLOCKED_VERIFY`,
`SCOPE_VIOLATION`, `RESUME_STATE_DIVERGED`, `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`,
`ABORTED`.

`READY_FOR_PR` and `ABORTED` are **terminal** — they have no outgoing
transitions. Every other state has at least one documented way out.

Which blocking states can be continued, and how, is declared in
`src/core/resume-policy.ts`:

| State | Resumable | Unattended resume eligible | Human decision | Allowed resume phases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BLOCKED_AUTH` | yes | no | yes | `IMPLEMENT`, `REVIEW`, `REMEDIATE` |
| `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT` | yes | **yes** | no | `IMPLEMENT`, `REVIEW`, `REMEDIATE` |
| `BLOCKED_VERIFY` | yes | no | yes | `REMEDIATE` |
| `SCOPE_VIOLATION` | no | no | yes | *(none)* |
| `RESUME_STATE_DIVERGED` | no | no | yes | *(none)* |
| `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` | yes | no | yes | all four |

The **allowed resume phases are derived from the transition table**, not
maintained by hand, and the schema validates against that same derived set. So
the contract cannot accept a re-entry point the loop could never reach — for
example `VERIFY` after a usage-limit block, when `VERIFYING` is not a successor
of `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT` at all. A state that cannot be continued must not carry
a resume point either.

`BLOCKED_AUTH` re-enters through `AUTH_PREFLIGHT` and **preserves the stored
resume point**: a review interrupted by an expired token resumes at `REVIEW`,
not at `IMPLEMENT`.

### Unattended resume

"Eligible" is not "permitted". `automaticResumeEligible` only says a state may
be *considered*; the decision is made per task by the pure function

```ts
evaluateAutomaticResume(state, evidence)  // → { allowed, reasonCodes, missingChecks }
```

which grants a resume only when every check produced positive evidence: the
reported quota reset time exists, is a valid timestamp and has demonstrably
passed; the auth preflight passed again; repository id, canonical repository
root, canonical worktree path, pinned base commit and current commit all still
match; the worktree exists and is clean; and no divergence was reported.
Without a reliable reset timestamp, no unattended resume is ever granted.

There is still no resume runner — this build only decides and validates.

### Resume points

`resumeFrom` is structured, not a free-form string:

```json
{ "phase": "IMPLEMENT", "round": 1 }
```

Phases: `IMPLEMENT`, `VERIFY`, `REVIEW`, `REMEDIATE`. The round must lie in
`1..maxReviewRounds` and additionally within an absolute ceiling, so a parsed
value can never be `Infinity`, `NaN` or an unsafe integer.
`formatResumePoint()` renders the `IMPLEMENT_ROUND_1` shorthand for display
only, and `parseResumePoint()` validates everything it produces against
`ResumePointSchema` itself.

### `READY_FOR_PR`

The terminal success state must be fully settled and provable. The contract
requires a resolved full-SHA `basePinnedCommit` and `currentCommit`,
`worktreeCleanAtCheckpoint === true`, `blockedAgent`, `resumeFrom` and
`reportedResetAt` all `null`, and a `reviewRound` between 1 and
`maxReviewRounds` — the state is only reachable through a real `REVIEWING` pass.

### Runtime API

`src/core/task-state.ts` exports exactly three runtime values:

```ts
TaskStateSchema        // the contract: shape + every cross-field invariant
parseTaskState()       // throwing validator
safeParseTaskState()   // non-throwing validator
```

plus the two TypeScript types needed to use them, `TaskState` and
`TaskStateInput`. Types are erased at build time and add nothing to the runtime
surface. `tests/public-state-api.test.ts` pins that set exactly, so adding to it
has to be a deliberate decision.

Nothing else is public. The weaker *structural* schema
(`TaskStateObjectSchema`), the field-level schemas (`GitShaSchema`,
`IsoDateTimeSchema`, `FindingRecordSchema`), `ResumePointSchema`, `MAX_ROUND`,
the contract-version constant and the evidence helper all live in their own
modules and are used internally only. Three of them are *weaker* validators:
handing them to a caller would offer a way to validate a state while bypassing
the invariants that make it trustworthy. `package.json#exports` publishes only
the CLI entry point and the generated JSON Schema, so `dist/core/**` has no
deep-import path either.

### Transitions

`src/core/transitions.ts` holds one explicit table plus
`canTransition(from, to)` and `assertTransition(from, to)`. Forbidden
transitions are *derived* from the table, never maintained separately. There is
no blanket "any state may enter any error state" rule: each error edge is listed
with the reason it can physically occur there. For example `VERIFYING` cannot
enter `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT`, because verification runs deterministic local
commands and consumes no agent quota.

## Not implemented yet

Planned commands — mentioned for orientation only, none of them exist in this
build: task creation, worktree setup, the implement/verify/review loop, resume
handling, and finding-fingerprint computation.
