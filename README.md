# agent-orchestrator (`agent-loop`)

Foundation for a repository-agnostic orchestrator that will coordinate two
already-installed CLI agents:

- **Claude Code** — the only agent allowed to write.
- **Codex CLI** — a strictly read-only reviewer.

Both are intended to run on their existing **subscription logins**, never on
API keys.

> **There is no orchestration loop in this build.** Task creation, worktree
> management, implement/verify/review rounds and resume handling are not
> implemented. No command in this build starts an agent.

What *is* implemented:

1. A standalone TypeScript CLI project.
2. The binding **single-task state contract** (Zod → generated JSON Schema,
   plus an explicit state-transition table).
3. The read-only diagnosis command `agent-loop doctor`.
4. The **repository-profile contract and repository resolution** (Zod →
   generated JSON Schema, plus a fail-closed resolver). This is a runtime
   library layer with no command attached: it can tell you what contract
   governs a repository, but nothing in this build acts on that answer.

## Requirements

- Node.js **22 or newer** (24 LTS recommended)
- npm
- Git

## Install

```powershell
npm install
```

## Build and verify

```powershell
npm run verify
```

`verify` is the canonical full Foundation verify command. It runs, in this
order: `schema:generate`, `typecheck`, `build`, `test:dist-doctor`,
`test:dist-trusted-profile`, `test:foundation-safe`,
`test:windows-tree-kill-tool-release`. `build` runs immediately before the two
dist artefact checks, so both always run against a fresh build, never a stale
or missing one, and there is only ever one build per `verify` run. The two test
gates run **sequentially**, in that order — the real-process harness never runs
alongside the foundation set.

`test:dist-trusted-profile` checks the *built* trusted-profile module
(`dist/config/internal/trusted-profile.js`): that it resolves the OS user
profile through `os.userInfo()`, that a child process with spoofed profile
environment variables gets the identical answer, and that no remnant of the
removed PowerShell resolver survives in the shipped artefact.

**`test:foundation-safe` is not "all tests", but it is the full regression
set.** It runs every vitest file except one:
`tests/windows-tree-kill-tool-release.test.ts`. That file is excluded (via
vitest's `--exclude` flag) not because it is unstable, but because it drives
real-process churn of its own — a child Node harness process per case plus a
detached, deliberately surviving Node helper — which intermittently
destabilised unrelated files running in parallel beside it (AO-008-S2-R1-F1).
It runs in its own serial gate, `test:windows-tree-kill-tool-release`, with
`--no-file-parallelism`, and never alongside the foundation set. Together the
two gates cover every vitest file exactly once.

`tests/exec.test.ts` — the real exec-lifecycle suite — is **no longer
excluded**. It is a regular part of `test:foundation-safe`, and therefore of
`verify`. The temporary AO-008 exclusion it used to carry was retired in
AO-008-S3.

There is currently no CI workflow in this repository (no `.github/workflows`);
`npm run verify` is the complete local contract until one is added, and any
future CI must call it, or run an equivalent, non-optional dist-doctor step.

The individual steps remain available on their own:

```powershell
npm run schema:generate     # regenerate schemas/task-state.schema.json from Zod
npm run typecheck           # tsc --noEmit, strict
npm test                    # vitest, unrestricted — every file, including the
                             # real-process tool-release harness, in one run
npm run test:foundation-safe  # vitest, excluding only the tool-release harness —
                               # the set `verify` runs first
npm run test:windows-tree-kill-tool-release
                              # the real-process tool-release harness on its own,
                              # serially (--no-file-parallelism); the gate
                              # `verify` runs last
npm run build                # emit dist/ (Node-executable CLI)
npm run test:dist-doctor     # run only the dist-artefact child check
                              # (tests/dist-artifact/run-completion-dist-artifact.mjs),
                              # against whatever dist/ already exists — no build
npm run verify:dist-doctor   # build, then check the *built* doctor run-completion
                              # artefact (dist/doctor/run-completion.js) in a
                              # separate Node process — not the TypeScript source
npm run test:dist-trusted-profile   # run only the built trusted-profile check
                              # (tests/dist-artifact/trusted-profile-dist-artifact.mjs),
                              # against whatever dist/ already exists — no build
npm run verify:dist-trusted-profile # build, then check the *built* trusted-profile
                              # module (dist/config/internal/trusted-profile.js)
```

Both dist artefact checks are plain Node scripts, not vitest test files, so
they are never picked up by vitest's default `tests/**/*.test.ts` glob and a
plain `npm test` on a clean checkout (no `dist/` yet) does not depend on a
prior build.

`schemas/task-state.schema.json` is **generated**. Do not edit it by hand — a
test fails if it no longer matches the Zod schema in `src/core/task-state.ts`.

## Link the CLI globally

```powershell
npm link
agent-loop --help
```

`bin.agent-loop` points at `dist/cli/index.js`, so `npm run build` must have run
first.

## `agent-loop doctor`

```powershell
agent-loop doctor
```

A read-only local diagnosis. It:

- reports which of four API-key environment variables are `SET` / `NOT_SET`
  (never their values, lengths, prefixes or hashes) and builds each probe's
  child environment from a **per-probe allow-list** rather than by cleaning a
  copy of the caller's environment. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is **not**
  forwarded to any probe — not to `node`/`npm`/`git`, and not to the Claude auth
  probe either: a login check handed a token out of the environment would only
  prove its own input, while the doctor has to verify the *stored* login that
  will really be used. Its presence is reported as `SET`/`NOT_SET` and its value
  is never read or logged;
- probes the locally installed CLIs with `--version` / `--help` from a static
  allow-list of commands, and records argv, exit code, start/end time,
  duration, a fixed failure code and whether the process started at all. The
  probes' `stdout`/`stderr` are **discarded**: only an extracted version
  number and allow-listed flag/subcommand names survive (see
  [Artefacts](#artefacts) and [Version detection](#version-detection)). Every
  probe runs with a wall-clock timeout **and**
  a hard byte budget per stream, both enforced while the output streams; a
  child that exceeds either has termination **attempted, best-effort** — on
  Windows via `taskkill /T /F` with a validated numeric PID, so a `.cmd`
  shim's real program is targeted too, not just the shim. The module then
  waits, with a bound, for the immediate child's `close` event — not for a
  verified absence of the whole tree — reporting a distinct failure code
  (`PROCESS_TREE_KILL_FAILED`) if that event is not observed within the grace
  window. What that attempt does and does not guarantee is spelled out in
  [Windows process-tree termination](#windows-process-tree-termination);
- checks that Claude Code reports a **Claude subscription** login and that
  Codex reports a **ChatGPT** login, using a fail-closed allow-list. The Codex
  check accepts *only* a command whose total normalised output — stdout and
  stderr together — is exactly the single line `Logged in using ChatGPT`. (The
  installed Codex CLI 0.146.0 writes that line to stderr and leaves stdout
  empty, which is why both streams are evaluated as one.) Extra words, an extra
  line, a mixed "ChatGPT and API key" message, a plan suffix, a warning, a
  banner or a localised wording all fail closed;
- probes Node/npm/Git/Claude/Codex versions and write access to the
  diagnostics directory and the orchestrator home, using reversible probe files
  that are deleted immediately. Those two directories are the only write
  targets: the doctor never probes, creates or writes a path named by an
  environment variable.

It never runs an agent task, never modifies a repository or any configuration,
never changes global environment variables, never performs a login, and never
reads a credential store.

### How `runCommand` starts a process

`runCommand` never assembles a free-form command string out of caller input.
Every argument is first validated against a conservative allow-list
(`SAFE_ARG_PATTERN` in `src/doctor/exec.ts`), which already excludes quotes and
shell metacharacters. Beyond that there are exactly **two** execution paths, and
they have deliberately different properties.

**A. Direct executables.** The resolved executable and its arguments are handed
to `spawn` structurally: a literal argument vector, `shell: false`, no shell and
no command processor anywhere in the chain. Nothing on this path is re-parsed by
a shell or an interpreter.

**B. `.cmd` / `.bat` targets.** Node cannot spawn a batch file directly, so this
path runs it through the trusted Windows command processor **on purpose**.
`cmd.exe` therefore does perform its own parsing of the command line it is
given, and this document does not claim otherwise. What is claimed is that the
command line it parses is not freely constructed:

- the interpreter is the trusted, environment-independent `cmd.exe` resolved
  through `src/doctor/internal/windows-system-tools.ts`. `COMSPEC` is never
  read, so a caller-controlled `COMSPEC` cannot substitute the interpreter;
- it is invoked as `cmd.exe /d /s /c "<inner>"` with `shell: false` and
  `windowsVerbatimArguments: true`, so Node performs no quoting of its own and
  the string `cmd.exe` receives is exactly the one this module built;
- every argument is encoded by the strict, fail-closed batch codec
  (`src/doctor/internal/windows-batch-command.ts`): each one — including an
  empty one — is wrapped in a matched quote pair so it produces exactly one
  batch parameter, and every character that remains special *inside* quotes
  (`(`, `)`, `%`, `!`, `^`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `|`) is caret-escaped. The batch
  target reads those arguments back as `%~1`, `%~2`, …; that is part of the
  contract, not an accident of the encoding;
- a literal `"` has no encoding that round-trips through this transport, so an
  argument or a target path containing one is **refused**, not guessed at. An
  explicit batch path with an embedded quote is refused *before* any resolution
  is attempted, so the refusal can never be masked by a "not found" result.

The honest statement for path B is therefore not "no parsing happens" — it is
that the batch command line is narrowly encoded and fail-closed, with no free,
user-controlled command-string construction anywhere in it.

### Windows process-tree termination

The termination path is deliberately small, and its guarantee is deliberately
narrow. It is a separate mechanism from the two execution paths above and shares
none of their command-line construction. What is implemented is exactly this:

- Windows tree termination uses **only** the validated system-tool path for
  `taskkill.exe`, resolved through the trusted boundary
  (`src/doctor/internal/windows-system-tools.ts`). There is **no `PATH` and no
  `COMSPEC` fallback** of any kind.
- The tool is invoked as `taskkill /PID <root pid> /T /F`, with
  `shell: false`, `windowsHide: true` and `stdio: 'ignore'`.
- **No process enumeration** is performed anywhere on this path: no WMI, no
  `wmic`, no PowerShell, no `tasklist`.

On POSIX the equivalent step targets the child's process group
(`kill(-pid, SIGKILL)`), falling back to the immediate child — the same
best-effort shape, with the same limits.

#### The supervisor is asynchronous

- The `taskkill` attempt is supervised **asynchronously**. The event loop is
  never blocked synchronously waiting for the tool (there is no
  `execFileSync`).
- The tool attempt is **time-bounded** by its own timeout
  (`WINDOWS_TREE_KILL_TIMEOUT_MS`, stage 1). The caller's existing child-grace
  window (`killGraceMs`) follows it as stage 2.
- **First termination reason wins**: a later event can never overwrite the
  reason the result already settled on.
- The tree-kill attempt and the settlement are each **exactly-once guarded**.
- Every timer the supervisor arms is `unref`'d, so a diagnostic never holds the
  process open on its own.

#### What `processTreeKilled: true` does and does not mean

`processTreeKilled: true` means **exactly one thing**: the best-effort
tree-kill mechanism reported success.

It does **not** mean:

- kernel-level ownership of the process tree;
- a verified absence of descendants;
- a process tree observed to be empty.

Two further honesties follow from that:

- a `taskkill` tool process can, under OS or policy failures, **outlive the
  settlement**. The supervisor then requests one bounded, best-effort kill of
  that tool process and releases its handle from the event loop; it never waits
  for a confirmation that may never come. What is guaranteed is only that the
  supervisor stops waiting on it and stops holding the event loop open for it;
- when the tool attempt does not succeed there is exactly one fallback: a
  direct kill of the **immediate child**. It reaches the immediate child only,
  never a descendant, and is therefore deliberately *not* reported as a
  successful tree kill.

**Windows Job Objects** would be the separate architecture for hard,
kernel-enforced ownership — a child assigned to a job the kernel tears down
with it, rather than a tool process asked to do the tearing down. That is not
part of the current contract.

#### Test gates for this path

- `test:foundation-safe` carries the ordinary foundation and execution
  regression set, including the real exec-lifecycle suite
  (`tests/exec.test.ts`) and the deterministic supervisor and race suites.
- The real-process tool-release probe
  (`tests/windows-tree-kill-tool-release.test.ts`) runs **separately and
  serially**, in its own gate. It starts real processes — a child Node harness
  per case, which in turn spawns a detached, long-lived Node helper that stands
  in for the tool process — but it does **not** start a real `taskkill.exe` for
  this mechanism: the supervisor's tool seam is injected, so the tool path and
  the tool's `kill()` are the harness's own. It exercises `kill()` returning
  `false`, `kill()` throwing, an ignored `kill()` (the helper survives by
  construction), both the timeout and the `cancel()` trigger, the `unref`-based
  release, and a negative control without `unref` that must hang. What it proves
  is that this Node process still resolves and exits while the tool process is
  provably still alive — **not** that a real `taskkill.exe` can always be
  terminated.
- `verify` runs those gates sequentially, foundation set first.

See [Build and verify](#build-and-verify) for the exact commands.

### Artefacts

The orchestrator is repository-agnostic, so **nothing is ever written relative
to the current working directory**. Persistent diagnostics go to the per-user
application-data root, and **every run gets its own immutable directory**:

```
%USERPROFILE%\.agent-orchestrator\diagnostics\doctor\runs\<run-id>\   (Windows)
$HOME/.agent-orchestrator/diagnostics/doctor/runs/<run-id>/           (POSIX)
```

`<run-id>` is a UTC timestamp plus a cryptographically random UUID, validated
as a single path segment, e.g. `20260801T121500123Z-<uuid>`.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `cli-capabilities.txt` | Structured capability summary — facts only, no process output |
| `doctor-report.json` | Machine-readable report, carrying its own run id and run path |
| `COMPLETED` | End-of-run marker: the fixed protocol version `agent-loop-doctor-run/1` and nothing else |

The console summary prints the exact run directory it used and whether the run
completed.

#### The run protocol is append-only

Each file is created **once**, directly under its final name, through a single
exclusive handle — written, `fsync`ed where the filesystem supports it, and
closed. There is no temporary file, no `rename`, no hard link and no unlink
anywhere in the persistence path:

- the run directory is created with `mkdir` **without** `recursive`, so an
  already existing directory is an error and never a reuse;
- the file name must resolve directly inside that run directory; separators,
  `..` and absolute names are refused;
- a symbolic link or Windows junction anywhere in the directory path aborts the
  write;
- **nothing is ever overwritten.** The file is opened with `wx`, so whether the
  name is free is answered by the kernel in the same syscall that would create
  it. There is deliberately no `lstat`-then-open sequence, because that gap is
  the race — and no ownership check, because there is nothing to take ownership
  of. (An earlier scheme proved ownership by looking for a marker string
  *inside* the existing file; that marker is printed into every artefact, so
  anyone could plant it. A later one finalised a temporary file with
  `link`, falling back to a check-then-`rename` that silently replaces an
  existing target on both Windows and POSIX.);
- **nothing is ever deleted.** A run directory, once created, stays — including
  when the run failed. Partial artefacts are left in place as diagnostic
  evidence.

#### Completion

`COMPLETED` is written **last**, and only after both artefacts are fully
written, synced and closed, and the run directory contains exactly those two
files and nothing else. It is created with the same exclusive `wx` semantics and
is never replaced.

- A run directory **with** a `COMPLETED` file whose content is exactly
  `agent-loop-doctor-run/1` is a finished run.
- A run directory **without** that marker — or with one carrying a different
  protocol version — is incomplete. **Consumers must ignore it**, whichever
  artefacts happen to be present. `listCompletedRuns()` in
  `src/doctor/run-completion.ts` is the supported way to enumerate runs and
  implements exactly that rule.
- `agent-loop doctor` exits `0` only if the marker was created.

`doctor-report.json` is written *before* the marker, so it cannot know whether
the run finished and does not claim to. It names the run id, the run directory,
its own intended path, the protocol version and the marker file to look for —
but carries no completion or cleanup status, and does not list itself among the
artefacts it reports as written. Completion is a fact about the directory, not
a statement in the document.

#### Report schema version

`doctor-report.json` carries its own `schemaVersion`. **The current format is
v4**, and every report this version writes states `"schemaVersion": 4`.

v4 replaces two v3 names, both because `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is now withheld
from every probe rather than forwarded:

| v3 (historical) | v4 (current) |
| --- | --- |
| `environmentAssessment.preservedAuthVars` | `environmentAssessment.withheldAuthVars` |
| check id `env:oauth-token-preserved` | check id `env:oauth-token-withheld` |

The field and the check say the opposite of what their v3 names claimed, so a
consumer written against v3 must not read a v4 document: check `schemaVersion`
before anything else. v3 is only the previous format — nothing writes it any
more, and existing v3 files are never rewritten, migrated or reinterpreted.

#### The protocol is fixed, and binds only to `(runsRoot, runId)`

The two artefact names and the marker name are **not configurable**. There is
no parameter anywhere in `src/doctor/run-completion.ts`'s public functions
through which a caller can name a different or additional required file — the
three-entry shape a completed run must have is a single internal constant, not
an argument.

`completeRun(runsRoot, runId)` and `inspectRun(runsRoot, runId)` take exactly
that: a trusted runs root and a run id, never a `runDirectory` path a caller
could point anywhere. The run directory is always computed internally as
`join(runsRoot, runId)`, after `runId` is validated against the same schema
the run directory was created with. The result must then be a *lexical and
canonical* direct child of `runsRoot` — both checked independently, with no
symlink or Windows junction anywhere between them — before either function
reads a byte from it. A validly-named run directory living under a different
parent, reached through a nested path, or sitting behind a junction is
rejected before it is ever inspected.

Producer and consumer — `completeRun` and `inspectRun` — run through the
*same* internal validators, not two independently maintained copies. Every
path segment that this process cannot conclusively `lstat` (a permission
error, for instance, on an intermediate directory) is treated exactly as
suspiciously as a segment proven to be a link: neither is ever accepted as
"probably fine".

After creating the marker, `completeRun` does not simply trust its own write.
It re-runs the *entire* completed-run validation — the same one `inspectRun`
uses — before reporting success, and reports failure (never `COMPLETED`,
never `completed: true`) if anything about the run no longer validates at
that point, including a mutation an external process made in the instant
between the marker write and that re-check.

None of this claims a stronger atomicity guarantee than Node and the
filesystem actually provide. The orchestrator is built for a local,
single-writer doctor run: it does not defend against a second process racing
the same run directory concurrently. What it does guarantee is narrower: a
successful `completeRun` return means the full contract held at the moment
that call returned, and every later reader of a run directory — `inspectRun`,
`listCompletedRuns`, any future consumer — re-validates the complete contract
from scratch rather than trusting a past success. A writer that modifies the
directory *after* `completeRun` has already returned is not something this
module can prevent; it is something the next `inspectRun` call catches.

Retention of old completed runs is not implemented yet — they are left alone.

### What the artefacts may contain

Both artefacts are built from a closed vocabulary. Raw CLI `stdout`/`stderr`,
exception messages and unknown status output are **not representable** in
them:

- **capability probes** contribute only: the probe id, the program as a fixed
  known label, the statically configured argv, start status, exit code,
  timestamps, duration, a fixed timeout/spawn/output-limit code, an allow-listed
  `errno` identifier, a strictly extracted version number, allow-listed
  subcommand and flag names, boolean capability answers, and a flag recording
  that the raw output was discarded. **The former raw `--help`/`--version` dump
  in `cli-capabilities.txt` was removed for security reasons:** pattern-based
  redaction cannot recognise unknown sensitive content, so process output is
  discarded rather than sanitised. Token recognition is conservative — a token
  must match a strict syntactic pattern *and* appear in a closed vocabulary, so
  a probe cannot introduce a new string into an artefact; output that yields no
  recognised token leaves the capability `UNKNOWN`, which fails closed;
- **auth checks** carry a fixed reason code, its static description, the
  constant argv, the numeric exit code, and — only on PASS — typed allow-list
  evidence. For Claude that is exactly `loggedIn`, `authMethod`, `apiProvider`
  and `subscriptionType`; account email, organisation id and organisation name
  are never copied, on success or failure;
- **CLI versions** are reported as a bare numeric triple, never as a whole
  output line — see [Version detection](#version-detection);
- **filesystem failures** are reported as a fixed code plus an `errno`
  identifier drawn from a closed allow-list (`ENOENT`, `EACCES`, `EPERM`, …);
  anything else becomes `UNKNOWN`;
- **every error** a user ever sees goes through one central safe formatter. It
  emits only string literals written in this repository: a sentence looked up
  in a static table by the error's closed domain id, or the fixed code
  `UNEXPECTED_ERROR`. Our own errors are recognised **by `instanceof` alone**;
  there is no `Symbol.for` marker, no `safeMessage` property and no
  duplicate-module fallback, because all three let a foreign object choose the
  text that gets printed. A foreign `error.name`, `error.code` or
  `error.message` is never printed, however well-formed it looks, and an error
  from a second loaded copy of this package fails closed to `UNEXPECTED_ERROR`.

### Version detection

Each `--version` probe has its **own** fully anchored parser, derived from the
output of the actually installed CLIs (observed 2026-08-01):

| Probe | Expected `stdout` | Reported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node.version` | `v24.18.1` | `24.18.1` |
| `npm.version` | `11.12.1` | `11.12.1` |
| `git.version` | `git version 2.55.0.windows.3` | `2.55.0` |
| `claude.version` | `2.1.220 (Claude Code)` | `2.1.220` |
| `codex.version` | `codex-cli 0.146.0` | `0.146.0` |

The rules are deliberately strict:

- only these five probes extract a version at all. A `--help` probe has no
  parser, so it can never contribute one;
- the probe's whole normalised output must be **one** non-empty line, and that
  entire line must match that probe's pattern. A prefix, a suffix, an extra
  line, a banner, help prose or an account line means the output is not the
  format we know;
- only `stdout` is read — a version on `stderr` is not the expected output of
  these commands;
- the reported value is a bare numeric triple. No word from the line — not
  `git version`, not `(Claude Code)`, not `codex-cli`, not a `.windows.N` build
  suffix — can reach a report or an artefact.

This is brittle on purpose: if a CLI changes its output format the version
becomes `UNKNOWN` rather than being guessed at. The previous implementation
scanned any line for anything dotted-numeric and consequently reported versions
taken from account lines and help text.

`src/auth/redaction.ts` remains as a defence-in-depth helper for future
free-form text. It is deliberately *not* the boundary and is not applied to any
persisted artefact — the boundary is that unknown text is never copied at all.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | `overallStatus: PASS` — every mandatory check passed |
| `1` | `overallStatus: FAIL` — a check failed, or a mandatory check only warned |

A `WARN` on a non-mandatory check does not fail the run. The only warnings
modelled that way are ones with a documented reason why they are neither a
security nor an execution risk — for example an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present in
the parent environment, which is removed from every child environment by a
unit-tested guard and therefore cannot reach an agent.

The auth checks **fail closed**: they pass only on positively recognised
subscription output. Unknown, empty or unparseable status output is a failure,
not a pass. A `FAIL` from `agent-loop doctor` is a real finding about the local
machine, not a defect in the tool.

### Configuration

**There is none.** No environment variable and no CLI flag influences any path
this build reads or writes.

That still holds now that repository profiles exist. A profile is *repository-side*
configuration: it is found at one fixed path relative to a canonical repository
root the caller stated explicitly, and no variable can name it, relocate it,
rename it or supply a substitute — see
[the repository-profile contract](#the-repository-profile-contract).

The persistent write root is:

```
<OS user profile>\.agent-orchestrator\      (Windows)
<OS user profile>/.agent-orchestrator/      (POSIX)
```

Two removed overrides, and why:

- `AGENT_LOOP_HOME` used to relocate the write root. A variable that redirects
  where a diagnostics run writes its files is a privilege the diagnosis does not
  need. If it is still set, the value is ignored and never read or printed; the
  doctor reports a non-blocking warning carrying only the fixed code
  `UNSUPPORTED_HOME_OVERRIDE_IGNORED`.
- `AGENT_LOOP_WORKTREES_ROOT` used to name a directory that the doctor then
  created a write-probe file in — the same class of defect, one step removed.
  Both the variable and that probe are gone: `agent-loop doctor` does not read
  it, does not resolve it, and writes nothing outside the orchestrator data
  root. Worktree-root configuration returns with the repository/worktree
  onboarding work, with its own explicit validation.

#### How the profile directory is determined

Not by `os.homedir()`. On Windows that function returns `%USERPROFILE%`
whenever the variable is set, so calling it would make the write root
environment-controlled with extra steps. Instead
(`src/config/internal/trusted-profile.ts`):

- `os.userInfo()` is called directly, in this process — no child process, no
  shell, no interpreter, no search list, no output to parse and no
  environment consulted. On Windows it resolves the profile directory from
  the process token; on POSIX, from the passwd entry for the real uid;
- the call itself, the returned value, and that value's `homedir` field are
  each validated behind their own narrow boundary: an unusable dependency, a
  query that throws, a non-object result or a throwing `homedir` accessor are
  all refused fail-closed, never surfaced as a foreign exception;
- the `homedir` value must be a non-empty, non-whitespace string with no
  embedded NUL, and must be absolute;
- it is then canonicalised and the canonical path must, on re-validation,
  `stat` as an existing directory.

**There is no fallback.** A query, validation or canonicalisation failure
fails closed with `TRUSTED_PROFILE_UNAVAILABLE`; it never degrades to an
environment value, and the static error text carries no path, user name,
errno or foreign exception detail.

Tests redirect the root through internal dependency injection
(`src/config/internal/path-provider.ts`), which is not exported from the
package, not reachable from the CLI and reads no environment value.
`tests/paths.test.ts` additionally runs real isolated child processes with each
of those variables manipulated and requires the resolved root to be identical
every time.

## The task-state contract

Source of truth: `src/core/task-state.ts` (Zod 4).
Generated artefact: `schemas/task-state.schema.json` (via `z.toJSONSchema()`).

### States

Regular: `CREATED`, `REPOSITORY_RESOLVED`, `CONFIG_VALIDATED`, `AUTH_PREFLIGHT`,
`GIT_PREFLIGHT`, `WORKTREE_READY`, `CONTEXT_LOADING`, `IMPLEMENTING`,
`VERIFYING`, `REVIEWING`, `REMEDIATING`, `READY_FOR_PR`.

Blocking / terminal: `BLOCKED_AUTH`, `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT`, `BLOCKED_VERIFY`,
`SCOPE_VIOLATION`, `RESUME_STATE_DIVERGED`, `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`,
`ABORTED`.

`READY_FOR_PR` and `ABORTED` are **terminal** — they have no outgoing
transitions. Every other state has at least one documented way out.

Which blocking states can be continued, and how, is declared in
`src/core/resume-policy.ts`:

| State | Resumable | Unattended resume eligible | Human decision | Allowed resume phases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BLOCKED_AUTH` | yes | no | yes | `IMPLEMENT`, `REVIEW`, `REMEDIATE` |
| `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT` | yes | **yes** | no | `IMPLEMENT`, `REVIEW`, `REMEDIATE` |
| `BLOCKED_VERIFY` | yes | no | yes | `REMEDIATE` |
| `SCOPE_VIOLATION` | no | no | yes | *(none)* |
| `RESUME_STATE_DIVERGED` | no | no | yes | *(none)* |
| `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` | yes | no | yes | all four |

The **allowed resume phases are derived from the transition table**, not
maintained by hand, and the schema validates against that same derived set. So
the contract cannot accept a re-entry point the loop could never reach — for
example `VERIFY` after a usage-limit block, when `VERIFYING` is not a successor
of `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT` at all. A state that cannot be continued must not carry
a resume point either.

`BLOCKED_AUTH` re-enters through `AUTH_PREFLIGHT` and **preserves the stored
resume point**: a review interrupted by an expired token resumes at `REVIEW`,
not at `IMPLEMENT`.

### Unattended resume

"Eligible" is not "permitted". `automaticResumeEligible` only says a state may
be *considered*; the decision is made per task by the pure function

```ts
evaluateAutomaticResume(state, evidence)  // → { allowed, reasonCodes, missingChecks }
```

which grants a resume only when every check produced positive evidence: the
reported quota reset time exists, is a valid timestamp and has demonstrably
passed; the auth preflight passed again; repository id, canonical repository
root, canonical worktree path, pinned base commit and current commit all still
match; the worktree exists and is clean; and no divergence was reported.
Without a reliable reset timestamp, no unattended resume is ever granted.

There is still no resume runner — this build only decides and validates.

### Resume points

`resumeFrom` is structured, not a free-form string:

```json
{ "phase": "IMPLEMENT", "round": 1 }
```

Phases: `IMPLEMENT`, `VERIFY`, `REVIEW`, `REMEDIATE`. The round must lie in
`1..maxReviewRounds` and additionally within an absolute ceiling, so a parsed
value can never be `Infinity`, `NaN` or an unsafe integer.
`formatResumePoint()` renders the `IMPLEMENT_ROUND_1` shorthand for display
only, and `parseResumePoint()` validates everything it produces against
`ResumePointSchema` itself.

### `READY_FOR_PR`

The terminal success state must be fully settled and provable. The contract
requires a resolved full-SHA `basePinnedCommit` and `currentCommit`,
`worktreeCleanAtCheckpoint === true`, `blockedAgent`, `resumeFrom` and
`reportedResetAt` all `null`, and a `reviewRound` between 1 and
`maxReviewRounds` — the state is only reachable through a real `REVIEWING` pass.

### Runtime API

`src/core/task-state.ts` exports exactly three runtime values:

```ts
TaskStateSchema        // the contract: shape + every cross-field invariant
parseTaskState()       // throwing validator
safeParseTaskState()   // non-throwing validator
```

plus the two TypeScript types needed to use them, `TaskState` and
`TaskStateInput`. Types are erased at build time and add nothing to the runtime
surface. `tests/public-state-api.test.ts` pins that set exactly, so adding to it
has to be a deliberate decision.

Nothing else is public. The weaker *structural* schema
(`TaskStateObjectSchema`), the field-level schemas (`GitShaSchema`,
`IsoDateTimeSchema`, `FindingRecordSchema`), `ResumePointSchema`, `MAX_ROUND`,
the contract-version constant and the evidence helper all live in their own
modules and are used internally only. Three of them are *weaker* validators:
handing them to a caller would offer a way to validate a state while bypassing
the invariants that make it trustworthy. `package.json#exports` publishes only
the CLI entry point and the generated JSON Schema, so `dist/core/**` has no
deep-import path either.

### Transitions

`src/core/transitions.ts` holds one explicit table plus
`canTransition(from, to)` and `assertTransition(from, to)`. Forbidden
transitions are *derived* from the table, never maintained separately. There is
no blanket "any state may enter any error state" rule: each error edge is listed
with the reason it can physically occur there. For example `VERIFYING` cannot
enter `BLOCKED_USAGE_LIMIT`, because verification runs deterministic local
commands and consumes no agent quota.

## The repository-profile contract

Source of truth: `src/repo/repo-profile.ts` (Zod 4).
Generated artefact: `schemas/repo-profile.schema.json` (via `z.toJSONSchema()`).

The orchestrator is repository-agnostic, which means the project-specific facts
have to live somewhere else: in the target repository, in a file that repository
reviews and owns. That file is the **repository profile**, and
`resolveRepository()` is what turns a path plus a profile into a validated,
frozen contract the rest of the system reads.

**Repo-profile and resolution are implemented; the orchestration loop that would
consume them is not.** Nothing in this build discovers a task, creates a
worktree, runs a verification command or starts an agent.

### Where the profile lives

```
<canonical repository root>/.agent-orchestrator/repo-profile.yaml
```

Exactly one location. There is no `.yml` spelling, no root-level alternative, no
upward directory search and no environment override. That is deliberate: the
profile declares which paths a writer agent may touch and which capabilities are
mandatory, so every additional candidate location is another way to put a policy
in force that nobody reviewed. A repository with no file at that exact path has
no profile, and resolution fails with `PROFILE_MISSING` rather than falling back
to a default the repository never agreed to.

YAML is the format because the file is written and reviewed by humans, and
because `yaml` was already a dependency. It is parsed as plain YAML 1.2 core
schema with merge keys disabled — no custom tags, so the document can only
produce the JSON data model.

`src/repo/profile-yaml.ts` owns that conversion, and two rules are established
there rather than downstream:

- **A document the parser warns about is refused**, with `PROFILE_PARSE_FAILED`.
  A warning marks a construct outside the plain 1.2 core schema — an unresolved
  tag, an ambiguous anchor or alias, a bad directive — so refusing it is what the
  format rule already claimed. It also removes a leak: `YAML.parse()` routes
  warnings to `process.emitWarning`, and those messages quote the offending
  source line, which put profile text on stderr past every containment rule the
  resolver observes for its own return value. No warning is handed to the
  library's logger at all, and `logLevel: 'silent'` is set besides. Errors are
  read from the parsed document rather than caught, because a silent log level
  makes `YAML.parse()` *discard* `doc.errors` instead of throwing — silencing
  the logger without that care would have turned malformed YAML into accepted
  YAML. A profile stream of more than one document is refused for the same
  reason: silently taking the first is what a single-document parse would do.
- **A `__proto__` mapping key is refused at any depth**, with
  `PROFILE_SCHEMA_INVALID`. The generated JSON Schema sets
  `additionalProperties: false` everywhere and so rejects it like any other
  unknown property, while Zod's `.strict()` treats `__proto__` as *not a key* and
  drops it silently — the same document meant two different things to the shipped
  schema and to the runtime. Nothing was polluted by that (Zod discards the
  value, and the resolver rebuilds its result field by field), but V1-02+ would
  have been built on the weaker half of a split contract. The check walks the
  parsed document tree, over the mapping keys the parser actually read and
  *before* any JavaScript object exists, because a check performed after the
  conversion can only see keys the conversion chose to keep.

### What a profile declares

```yaml
schemaVersion: 1
repository:
  id: fixture-alpha          # stable slug; becomes TaskState.repositoryId
  defaultBranch: main        # must exist locally; never guessed
taskSource:                  # declared only — nothing is discovered in this build
  kind: MARKDOWN_DIRECTORY
  path: tasks
context:                     # declared only — no file is opened in this build
  canonicalSources:
    - README.md
capabilities:
  codegraph: OPTIONAL        # or REQUIRED, which is fail-closed
verification:                # declared only — nothing is executed in this build
  phases:
    - phase: BUILD
      command: [npm, run, build]
    - phase: VERIFY
      command: [npm, run, verify]
scope:                       # declared only — no scope is enforced in this build
  allowedPaths: [src, tests]
  protectedPaths: [dist]     # wins over allowedPaths where the two overlap
completion:
  maxReviewRounds: 3         # bounded by the same RoundSchema as the state contract
remote:
  required: false            # a repository with no remote is a valid target
```

Unknown keys are refused at every level, and the fields are limited to those
with a concrete consumer. There is no UI, cloud-provider, CI-provider,
GitHub-specific, PR-automation, merge-policy or parallel-worker configuration —
a profile field that nothing reads is a promise the build cannot keep.

Verification commands are **argv vectors, not shell strings**, and every token
must be shell-inert, as must every path and the branch name. A repository
profile is input: it must not be able to place a shell metacharacter into a
command line at all. Paths are POSIX-shaped and repository-relative; an absolute
path, a drive letter, a backslash, a `..` segment and a `.` segment are each
refused by the schema, and containment is then re-checked against the canonical
root at resolution time.

**Default-branch names are limited in v1 to the safe ASCII-inert argument
grammar of the execution layer.** The branch name becomes an argument to a real
`git` process, and the hardened `runCommand` argument contract established in
AO-008 accepts only that grammar; the profile schema enforces it on the way in
rather than letting a value through that the execution layer would have to
refuse later. The practical consequence is worth stating plainly, because it is a
limit of this build and not of Git: a branch name Git accepts perfectly well —
`feature/café`, `Ünicode` — **cannot currently be profiled as `defaultBranch`**,
and such a profile is refused with `PROFILE_SCHEMA_INVALID`. Onboarding a
repository whose default branch carries non-ASCII characters therefore needs the
argument grammar widened first; V1-01 does not widen it.

Cross-field invariants that JSON Schema cannot express — a supported
`schemaVersion`, distinct verification phases, a mandatory `VERIFY` phase,
duplicate-free path lists — are enforced by `RepoProfileSchema` at runtime, and
the *structural* schema that lacks them stays internal, exactly as it does for
the task state.

### How a repository is resolved

`resolveRepository({ repositoryPath })` runs these steps and stops at the first
failure:

1. the input must be a non-empty **absolute** path with no NUL;
2. it is canonicalised with `realpath` and must be an existing directory;
3. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` must succeed, and its canonical answer must
   be *this* path — a subdirectory of a repository is `REPOSITORY_ROOT_MISMATCH`,
   not a silent promotion to the root;
4. `git rev-parse --git-dir` must succeed;
5. the profile directory and file are classified with `lstat`, so a link is seen
   rather than followed; either being a link is `REPOSITORY_PATH_UNSAFE`;
6. the file must be a regular file within a 256 KiB ceiling, and its canonical
   path must still be the joined one and still contained in the root;
7. it must parse as YAML and satisfy the contract;
8. every declared path is re-checked for containment against the canonical root;
9. the default branch must be a legal Git branch name (`check-ref-format` rules,
   implemented in-process) **and** must exist locally;
10. every `REQUIRED` capability must be positively available;
11. the remote expectation must hold.

The result is a deeply frozen `ResolvedRepository`. No raw YAML object is
carried through it, so no later step can re-derive a policy from the document.

Git is used **read-only** — `rev-parse` and `remote`, nothing else. No branch,
worktree, checkout, commit, fetch or push happens here. Execution goes through
the same hardened `runCommand` the doctor uses, and the child environment is
`createProbeEnv('capability:generic', …)`: `PATH` and `PATHEXT` and nothing
else. That is what a `git` process needs to start, and it is also what keeps
`GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_CONFIG_*` and every
other `GIT_*` variable out of the child, so which repository answers is decided
by the canonical path this module passes and by nothing in the environment.

**`process.cwd()` is never consulted.** The caller states the repository; a
relative or empty input is `REPOSITORY_PATH_INVALID` even when the working
directory *is* a valid repository. `tests/repo-resolution.test.ts` resolves the
same fixture from three different working directories and requires an identical
answer.

### CodeGraph capability

The profile declares `REQUIRED` or `OPTIONAL`. `REQUIRED` is fail-closed:
resolution refuses with `REQUIRED_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE` unless the capability
is *positively* proven. `OPTIONAL` records what was observed and resolves either
way.

The probe answers one question honestly — **does this repository carry a
CodeGraph index?** — by looking for a real `.codegraph` directory at the
canonical root, in-process, with no subprocess and no environment value. A
symlink there is not followed and yields `UNKNOWN`.

The status vocabulary is named after that evidence and nothing beyond it:

| status | what was observed | what it does **not** claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INDEX_PRESENT` | a real `.codegraph` directory at the canonical root | valid index contents, a *fresh* index, a configured MCP server, or a reachable `codegraph_explore` tool |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | no local index there | — |
| `UNKNOWN` | the probe could not conclude (a link, a permission failure, an I/O error) | — |

The positive member is `INDEX_PRESENT` rather than `AVAILABLE` deliberately.
`AVAILABLE` reads as "the capability can be used", and a consumer written
against that reading would be relying on something no code in this build
measures: the orchestrator runtime is not the agent session that owns the MCP
tools and cannot call one, so asserting reachability would be a fabricated pass.
The name was corrected before the first consumer existed, so nothing had to be
migrated. When a later slice can actually prove tool reachability, it earns a
second status of its own; it does not redefine this one.

So `REQUIRED` in a profile means **this repository must carry a local CodeGraph
index**, which is what the resolver can check. `UNKNOWN` never satisfies it —
"could not be determined" is representable rather than rounded to either answer —
and an `OPTIONAL` capability that is unavailable still resolves.

### Failure codes

Failures are data, never exceptions. Every expected condition returns a code
from a closed set together with a static sentence written in this repository:

`REPOSITORY_PATH_INVALID`, `REPOSITORY_NOT_FOUND`, `REPOSITORY_NOT_DIRECTORY`,
`REPOSITORY_PATH_UNSAFE`, `GIT_UNAVAILABLE`, `NOT_A_GIT_REPOSITORY`,
`REPOSITORY_ROOT_MISMATCH`, `PROFILE_MISSING`, `PROFILE_NOT_REGULAR_FILE`,
`PROFILE_TOO_LARGE`, `PROFILE_READ_FAILED`, `PROFILE_PARSE_FAILED`,
`PROFILE_SCHEMA_INVALID`, `DEFAULT_BRANCH_INVALID`, `DEFAULT_BRANCH_NOT_FOUND`,
`REQUIRED_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`, `REMOTE_REQUIRED_BUT_ABSENT`.

Nothing is interpolated into those sentences: not the repository path, not the
profile path, not the branch name, not a Zod issue message, not a YAML or `fs`
exception. Those messages quote paths, command lines and the offending input
itself, which is the class of value `src/core/safe-error.ts` exists to keep out
of user-facing output. `PROFILE_SCHEMA_INVALID` additionally carries an
`issueCount` — a count, not the issues.

## Not implemented yet

Planned commands — mentioned for orientation only, none of them exist in this
build: task discovery from a profile's `taskSource`, worktree setup, the
implement/verify/review loop, resume handling, and finding-fingerprint
computation. The repository profile *declares* the task source, the context
sources, the verification phases and the write scope; no code in this build
reads a task, opens a context file, runs a verification command or enforces a
scope.
